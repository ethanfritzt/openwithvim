### Open with Vim

Custom nautilus script to open files with vim in terminal. I am putting my bash script in the ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts directory. 
The options will show up when you right click on a file in nautilus. I am not sure what is best practice for this, and if you remove the scripts directory.
